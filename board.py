#  In order to keep the concept of "tries" in order to enter the orange cell, it is possible from every cell in which you can get to an orange cell
#  if you get the right dice number, to stay in place in case of getting a different number. for example:
#  if from [0,26] you can get to [3,26] if you roll 5, then also when the dice came out 1 or 3 you can stay in [0,26] until succeeding (or you can move - as you wish)
